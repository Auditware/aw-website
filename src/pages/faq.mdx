        text": "An Operational Security (OpSec) audit is a comprehensive review of your organization's security posture. Unlike smart contract audits that focus solely on code, OpSec audits examine your entire organization including team security practices, infrastructure, key management, communication protocols, and processes. We identify vulnerabilities across all operational domains and provide actionable remediation guidance."
